# Contributing to Kori Core

Thank you for your interest in contributing to **Kori Core**.

Kori is an early-stage system focused on building human-first, trustworthy
infrastructure for travel and local discovery. Contributions are welcome,
but this repository prioritizes architectural clarity and correctness over
feature velocity.

## Project Status

- This repository is in **early development**
- Many modules are intentionally incomplete or stubbed
- APIs and schemas may change

Please treat this as a system under construction.

## How to Contribute

At this stage, we welcome:
- architectural feedback
- documentation improvements
- bug reports or design suggestions
- small, well-scoped pull requests

Before submitting large changes, please open an issue to discuss intent.

## Coding Principles

- Favor clarity over cleverness
- Keep modules small and composable
- Avoid introducing hard dependencies without discussion
- Prefer explicit types and documented assumptions

## What Not to Contribute (for now)

- Large refactors
- Production-grade infrastructure
- Chain-specific implementations
- Monetization logic beyond existing scope

These will be introduced intentionally in later phases.

## Submitting Changes

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch
3. Keep commits focused and descriptive
4. Open a pull request with a clear explanation of intent
