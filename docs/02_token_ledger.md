# Token Ledger (Closed Loop)

C-token is a non-cashout utility/reward unit used for:
- rewarding referrals (link clicks)
- boosting visibility (pinning reviews/guides)
- engaging in-app actions (likes/follows/bookmarks, optional)

Design principle:
- Closed-loop economy: no direct cash-out for C-tokens
- Anti-click-game: rate limits + 1-click-1-reward constraints
- External revenue injection can occur through paid swaps / premium triggers (separate K-token funnel in later phases)
